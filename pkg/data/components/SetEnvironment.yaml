summary: Associates telemetry data with a specific environment context.
description: |-
  The SetEnvironment component receives an environment context from a Router and applies it to
  telemetry data flowing through the pipeline. This component acts as a junction point that marks
  all downstream components as belonging to a specific environment (e.g., dev, staging, production).

  This component is typically used in multi-environment routing scenarios where different
  environments require different processing, sampling, or export configurations.

      The name of the environment this component represents. This value is used by the Router
      component to generate routing rules and by downstream components to determine
      environment-specific configuration like API keys.
