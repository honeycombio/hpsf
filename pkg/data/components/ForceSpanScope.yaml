summary: Force the scope of a Refinery rule to be "span" rather than "trace".
description: |
  Normally, the scope of a Refinery rule is "trace", which means that when the
  rule has multiple conditions, it will match when any condition is true for any
  span in the trace, even if the conditions are not related to the same span.
  This component forces the scope of the rule to be "span" rather than "trace",
  so that the rule will only match when all conditions are true for the same
  span.
