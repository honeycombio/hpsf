    summary: The environment in which to enable the sampler
    description: |
      The environment in which to enable the sampler. If this field is
      not specified, the sampler will be enabled in the __default__ environment,
      which is what is used if the environment specified in the trace is not found.

    default: "__default__"
  - name: SampleRate
    summary: The target SampleRate
    description: |
      The target SampleRate. One of every SampleRate traces will be sampled. In other
      words, a sample rate of 5 means that 1 in 5 traces will be sampled. SampleRate
      is the inverse of the sampling probability. A sample rate of 1 means that every
      trace will be sampled.
