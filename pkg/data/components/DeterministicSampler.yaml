    summary: The target SampleRate.
    description: |
      The target SampleRate. One of every SampleRate traces will be sampled. In other
      words, a sample rate of 5 means that 1 in 5 traces will be sampled. SampleRate
      is the inverse of the sampling probability. A sample rate of 1 means that every
      trace will be sampled.
