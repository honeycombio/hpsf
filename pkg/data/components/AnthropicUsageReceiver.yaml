summary: Collects usage metrics (via metrics) and cost data (via logs) from Anthropic API
description: |
  The Anthropic Usage receiver collects detailed usage metrics and cost data from
  the Anthropic Admin API, providing observability into your Claude API consumption.
  
  This receiver periodically queries the Anthropic API and outputs data through
  two different channels:
  
  **Metrics channel**:
  - Usage metrics: Token counts (input/output), API calls, grouped by model,
    service tier, workspace, and API key
  
  **Logs channel**:
  - Cost data: Detailed spending information sent as structured usage logs,
    aggregated by workspace and description
  
  This dual-channel approach allows you to:
  - Monitor API usage patterns and trends via metrics
  - Track and analyze costs through usage logs
  - Set up alerts for usage thresholds
  - Implement chargeback or cost optimization workflows
  
  Note: Requires an Anthropic Admin API key with appropriate permissions to
  access usage and billing data.

    description: |
      The interval at which the receiver will query the Anthropic API
      for usage and cost data. Shorter intervals provide more real-time
      data but may increase API usage.
