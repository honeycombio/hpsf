kind: SampleByTraceDuration
name: Sample By Trace Duration
style: sampler
type: base
status: alpha
version: v0.1.0
summary: Samples traces based on root span duration
description: |
  This sampler checks the duration of the root span in a trace.
  If the root span exceeds the specified duration, the trace will be sampled
  at the specified rate (default 1).

    description: |
      The environment in which to enable the sampler. If this field is
      not specified, the sampler will be enabled in the __default__ environment,
      which is what is used if the environment specified in the trace is not found.

  - name: Duration
    summary: Traces longer than this duration (in milliseconds) will be sampled at the specified rate.
    description: |
      The duration (in milliseconds) that the root span must exceed for the trace
      to be sampled. If the root span's duration is greater than this value, the
      trace will be sampled at the specified rate.
