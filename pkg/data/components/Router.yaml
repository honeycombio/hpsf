summary: Routes traces, logs, and metrics to different Honeycomb environments
description: |-
  Routes telemetry data (traces, logs, and metrics) to different Honeycomb environments
  within the same pipeline deployment. Each Router component handles routing for a specific
  environment based on a telemetry attribute. One Router should be marked as the default
  to handle unmatched traffic.

    description: |
      The name of the resource attribute that will be checked to determine which
      environment the telemetry should be routed to. For example, "deployment.environment"
      or "service.namespace". This attribute should be present on incoming telemetry data.

    summary: Whether this router should handle unmatched telemetry
    description: |
      When set to true, this router will handle all telemetry that doesn't match
      any other router's environment name. Only one Router in a workflow should have
      this set to true.
