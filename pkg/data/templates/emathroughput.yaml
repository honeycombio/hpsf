summary: Limit the throughput of traces to Honeycomb using an EMA sampler
description: |
  Limit the throughput of traces to Honeycomb using an EMA sampler. This template
  accepts traces from an OTel receiver, converts them to Honeycomb format, and
  then samples them using an EMA Throughput Sampler before exporting them to
  Honeycomb. Control the volume of traces by modifying the GoalThroughputPerSec value in
  the properties section of the EMAThroughputSampler component.
