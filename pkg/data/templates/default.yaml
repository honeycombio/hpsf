summary: The default configuration that receives traces, metrics, and logs, applies deterministic sampling to traces and logs, and forwards them to the Honeycomb exporter.
description: |
  This is the default configuration that receives telemetry data via OpenTelemetry and forwards it
  to the Honeycomb exporter. Traces and logs are routed through a deterministic sampler with a
  sample rate of 100 (1 in 100 traces/logs are sampled), while metrics bypass sampling and are
  sent directly to Honeycomb. This configuration is useful for testing and debugging, or as a
  starting point for more complex configurations.
