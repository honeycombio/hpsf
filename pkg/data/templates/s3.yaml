kind: TemplateS3
version: v0.1.0
summary: A template for sending OpenTelemetry traces and logs to S3 for cold storage.
description: |
  This forwards all OpenTelemetry traces and logs to S3 for cold storage.
  Traces are also sent through an EMAThroughput Sampler so a subset are available
  in Honeycomb. OpenTelemetry metrics are also sent to Honeycomb.
